# Deployment

- If you have AWS, use as much managed infrastructure as you can: less ops work;

- Use `docker-machine` with the appropriate driver (e.g. [AWS EC2](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/), [digital ocean](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/digital-ocean/), [Google GCE](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/gce/), [lots of drivers](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/))

It's a good common vendor abstraction.
