# Gitiquette - Git Etiquette

This guide was shamelessly stolen and adapted from [this excellent blog post](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

If you find it hard to remember these rules you can create a [commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
hook that validates

## TLDR; The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](gitiquette/separate-subject-from-body.md)
1. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](gitiquette/limit-subject-line.md)
1. [Capitalise the subject line](gitiquette/capitalise-subject-line.md)
1. [Do not end the subject line with a full stop](gitiquette/no-full-stop-in-subject-line.md)
1. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](gitiquette/use-imperative-subject.md)
1. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](gitiquette/wrap-body.md)
1. [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](gitiquette/body-for-what-not-how.md)

## Introduction

Why good commit messages matter If you browse the log of any
random git repository, you will probably find its commit messages are more or
less a mess. For example, take a look at these gems from my early days
committing to Spring:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -5 --author cbeams --before "Fri Mar 26 2009"
```

```
e5f4b49 Re-adding ConfigurationPostProcessorTests after its brief removal in r814. @Ignore-ing the testCglibClassesAreLoadedJustInTimeForEnhancement() method as it turns out this was one of the culprits in the recent build breakage. The classloader hacking causes subtle downstream effects, breaking unrelated tests. The test method is still useful, but should only be run on a manual basis to ensure CGLIB is not prematurely classloaded, and should not be run as part of the automated build.
2db0f12 fixed two build-breaking issues: + reverted ClassMetadataReadingVisitor to revision 794 + eliminated ConfigurationPostProcessorTests until further investigation determines why it causes downstream tests to fail (such as the seemingly unrelated ClassPathXmlApplicationContextTests) 147709f Tweaks to package-info.java files
22b25e0 Consolidated Util and MutableAnnotationUtils classes into existing AsmUtils
7f96f57 polishing Yikes. Compare that with these more recent commits from the same repository:
```

```bash
$ git log --oneline -5 --author pwebb --before "Sat Aug 30 2014"
```

```
5ba3db6 Fix failing CompositePropertySourceTests
84564a0 Rework @PropertySource early parsing logic
e142fd1 Add tests for ImportSelector meta-data
887815f Update docbook dependency and generate epub
ac8326d Polish mockito usage
```

Which would you rather read?

The former varies wildly in length and form; the latter is concise and
consistent. The former is what happens by default; the latter never happens by
accident.

While many repositories' logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The
Linux kernel and git itself are great examples. Look at Spring Boot, or any
repository managed by Tim Pope.

The contributors to these repositories know that a well-crafted git commit
message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow
developers (and indeed to their future selves). A diff will tell you what
changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why. Peter Hutterer
makes this point well:

>Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't avoid it
completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it [as much] as possible.
Commit messages can do exactly that and as a result, a commit message shows
whether a developer is a good collaborator. If you haven't given much thought to
what makes a great git commit message, it may be the case that you haven't spent
much time using git log and related tools. There is a vicious cycle here:
because the commit history is unstructured and inconsistent, one doesn't spend
much time using or taking care of it. And because it doesn't get used or taken
care of, it remains unstructured and inconsistent.

But a well-cared for log is a beautiful and useful thing. git blame, revert,
rebase, log, shortlog and other subcommands come to life. Reviewing others'
commits and pull requests becomes something worth doing, and suddenly can be
done independently. Understanding why something happened months or years ago
becomes not only possible but efficient.

A project's long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability,
and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project's log. It's worth
taking the time to learn how to care for one properly. What may be a hassle at
first soon becomes habit, and eventually a source of pride and productivity for
all involved.

In this post, I am addressing just the most basic element of keeping a healthy
commit history: how to write an individual commit message. There are other
important practices like commit squashing that I am not addressing here. Perhaps
I'll do that in a subsequent post.

Most programming languages have well-established conventions as to what
constitutes idiomatic style, i.e. naming, formatting and so on. There are
variations on these conventions, of course, but most developers agree that
picking one and sticking to it is far better than the chaos that ensues when
everybody does their own thing.

A team's approach to its commit log should be no different. In order to create a
useful revision history, teams should first agree on a commit message convention
that defines at least the following three things:

**Style**. Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation. Spell
these things out, remove the guesswork, and make it all as simple as possible.
The end result will be a remarkably consistent log that's not only a pleasure to
read but that actually does get read on a regular basis.

**Content**. What kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any)
contain? What should it not contain?

**Metadata**. How should issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc. be
referenced?

Fortunately, there are well-established conventions as to what makes an
idiomatic git commit message. Indeed, many of them are assumed in the way
certain git commands function. There's nothing you need to re-invent. Just
follow the seven rules below and you're on your way to committing like a pro.

## The seven rules of a great git commit message

1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](gitiquette/separate-subject-from-body.md)
1. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](gitiquette/limit-subject-line.md)
1. [Capitalise the subject line](gitiquette/capitalise-subject-line.md)
1. [Do not end the subject line with a full stop](gitiquette/no-full-stop-in-subject-line.md)
1. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](gitiquette/use-imperative-subject.md)
1. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](gitiquette/wrap-body.md)
1. [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](gitiquette/body-for-what-not-how.md)

For example:

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or
so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of the commit and
the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the
body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`,
`shortlog` and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you are making
this change as opposed to how (the code explains that). Are there side effects
or other unintuitive consequences of this change? Here's the place to explain
them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single
 - space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom, like this:

Resolves: #123 See also: #456, #789
```
