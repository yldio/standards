# Purpose

The purpose of these standards are so we have a common way of working. That is beneficial because it means it's easier to get started in different projects and work with new team members.

This is not meant to restrict our way of working. For instance deciding between `express` and `hapi` is pointless because they both have their strengths and weaknesses, but deciding on a code style the purpose of a code style is bringing people together on coding standards ([i.e.](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+coding+standards+are+important)).

## Qualities of a good choice of standard

### Gets out of the way, is flexible;

Does not lock the developer in a corner when new requirements come.

### Production ready

- Has been battle hardened;
- There are success stories;
- Project members have experience with it;

### Promotes good coding practices;

- Promotes coding consistency;
- Allows more team members to work concurrently on the project;

There are very good reasons to have a common way of doing things in YLD, justifications for not complying with these may be "we have no ownership over these choices" but not "I don't agree with them so I'm not using them".
