## Limit the subject line to 50 characters

[Back](../gitiquette.md)

50 characters is not a hard limit, just a rule of thumb. Keeping subject lines
at this length ensures that they are readable, and forces the author to think
for a moment about the most concise way to explain what's going on.

Tip: If you're having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many
changes at once. Strive for atomic commits. GitHub's UI is fully aware of these
conventions. It will warn you if you go past the 50 character limit and will
truncate any subject line longer than 69 with an ellipsis. So shoot for 50
characters, but consider 69 the hard limit.
