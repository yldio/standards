## Wrap the body at 72 characters

[Back](../gitiquette.md)

Git never wraps text automatically. When you write the body of a commit message,
you must mind its right margin, and wrap text manually.

The recommendation is to do this at 72 characters, so that git has plenty of
room to indent text while still keeping everything under 80 characters overall.

A good text editor can help here. It's easy to configure Vim, for example, to
wrap text at 72 characters when you're writing a git commit.
